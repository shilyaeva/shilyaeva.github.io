Hello,

I would like to share the passion for creativity with you. Architect by profession I'm using watercolor for a long time and became familiar with its many technics and secrtes. Nevertheless every time creating something I'm opening new methods and opportunities. In contrast to oil colors or any other opaque covering colors watercolor doesn't forgive any mistakes, every attempt of correction is noticeable and destroys main advantages of watercolor: freshness, transparency and accuracy of stroke. Improvisation, skills and love to object of art - that way a good result will be possible.

I would appriciate to hear your opinion. Feel free contacting me to discuss any related topics and questions.

Ekaterina
